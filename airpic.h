/*! \mainpage Airpic Library Documentation
 * 
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * The Airpic Libraries include various tools to simplify and accelerate the 
 * development of C code for the PIC24 microcontroller. Airpic was designed for 
 * use with Project IRIS, a project created by Innovative Engineers at 
 * the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
 * 
 * \subsection microcontroller Microcontroller
 * These libraries were written for the PIC24FJ64GA002 microcontroller, but 
 * they are theoretically compatible with any PIC24FJ device. It should be 
 * relatively easy to adapt these libraries for use on virtually any PIC24 
 * microcontroller.
 * 
 * \subsection connections Connections
 * <p>
 * Airpic uses a variety of peripherals and pins on the PIC device.
 * <p><ul>
 * <li> airpic-timer.h uses Timer peripherals 1, 4, and 5. 
 * <li> airpic-statusled.h uses Timer peripheral 2, and pins RB15, RB14, and 
 * RB13 (physical pins 26, 25, and 24, respectively).
 * <li> airpic-i2c.h uses the I2C2 peripheral, and pins SDA2 and SCL2 (physical 
 * pins 6 and 7, respectively)
 * <li> airpic-serialgps.h uses the UART1 peripheral, and pins RP10 and RP11 
 * (physical pins 21 and 22, respectively).
 * <li> if the serial debugger messages are enabled, they will use RP6 and RP7 
 * (physical pins 15 and 16, respectively).
 * <p></ul>
 * More detailed information about pin connections are shown below:

 * <p>
 * WARNING!!! The PIC microcontroller is a 3.3V device. If something (like an
 * arduino's RX pin) tries to send data with a 5V logic level, there is a high 
 * chance you will damage the PIC! However, the PIC's outputs can be connected 
 * to inputs on a 5V device (for example, the debugging TX pin can be connected 
 * to the TX pin on an Arduino).
 * 
 * \subsection techinfo Compiler/Technical Information
 * Airpic was compiled using the XC16 compiler, version 1.32B. The IDE used was 
 * MPLAB X, version 4.00.

/**
 * @file airpic.h
 * @brief Configure microcontroller to use Airpic.
 * airpic.h consists of functions that are used to configure the PIC 
 * microcontroller to the specifications needed for the rest of the Airpic 
 * libraries to work.
 * <p>
 * In addition, the functions used to enable and disable the serial debugging
 * prompts are included here. The easiest way to see the debugger prompts is to 
 * attach an Arduino UNO's TX pin (digital pin 1) to the debugger TX pin. 
 * Yes, the TX pins go to each other. The Arduino UNO has its TX and RX pins 
 * labeled backwards relative to its USB port. Also: if you do it this way, do
 * NOT connect the UNO's RX pin directly to the PIC! The Arduino uses 5V logic
 * levels, which can damage the PIC microcontroller!
